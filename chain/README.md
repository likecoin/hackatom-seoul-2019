This chain codebase is a demo of our Civic Liker modules.

The codebase is basically [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk](gaia).

The modules are as follows:

- `chain/x/subscription`: automatically sending coins to a pool periodically.
- `chain/x/civicliker`: defines like actions and Civic Liker coin distribution logic.
